But most importantly, I've learned that in many areas of life, I can achieve success as long as I do not give up. It has also given me the drive to succeed in other parts of my life. So if I were to rewind back in my time, although there were a lot of hardships, I would do it all over again, for the lessons I've learned are too valuable to pass by.
